# Customer Order Management System

A **Spring Boot-based microservices application** that enables customers to place orders, receive email notifications, and earn loyalty points. It follows **event-driven architecture** using **Kafka** and **WebFlux** for communication.

## Architecture Overview
This project consists of **three microservices**:
1. **Order Management Service**  
   - Handles order creation and retrieval.
   - Publishes an event to Kafka after an order is placed.

2. **Email Service**  
   - Listens for order events from Kafka.
   - Sends confirmation emails to customers.

3. **Loyalty Service**  
   - Listens for order events from Kafka.
   - Processes loyalty points based on order amount.
   - Calls Email Service (via WebFlux) if points are awarded.

## Microservices and Data Flow
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Order Management Service
‚úÖ **Handles orders**  
‚úÖ **Publishes events to Kafka**  
‚úÖ **Stores orders in PostgreSQL**  

üöÄ **Flow**:
- Customer places an order.
- Order details are **saved** in the database.
- A **Kafka event is published** (`ORDER_CREATED` topic).
- Email Service and Loyalty Service consume this event.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Email Service
‚úÖ **Consumes Kafka events**  
‚úÖ **Sends confirmation emails to customers**  

üöÄ **Flow**:
- Listens for `ORDER_CREATED` event.
- Sends an **email confirmation** to the customer.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Loyalty Service
‚úÖ **Processes loyalty points**  
‚úÖ **Calls Email Service (via WebFlux) if points are awarded**  

üöÄ **Flow**:
- Listens for `ORDER_CREATED` event.
- Checks **loyalty rules**:
  - If the **order amount meets the threshold**, points are awarded.
  - Calls Email Service via **WebFlux** to notify the customer.
  - If no points are awarded, logs the event.
